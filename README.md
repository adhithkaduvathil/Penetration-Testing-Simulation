# Penetration Testing Simulation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a penetration testing simulation conducted in a controlled lab environment.  
The goal was to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them safely, and provide recommendations for remediation.  

## Tools Used
- **Kali Linux** – Testing environment  
- **Nmap** – Network scanning and host discovery  
- **Metasploit Framework** – Exploit development and vulnerability testing  
- **Burp Suite** – Web application vulnerability scanning  
- **Wireshark** – Packet capture and analysis  

## Project Steps
1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Used Nmap to scan for open ports and services.
   - Identified potential vulnerabilities in web and network services.

2. **Exploitation**
   - Tested known vulnerabilities using Metasploit in a safe environment.
   - Verified exploitation success while avoiding system damage.

3. **Web Application Testing**
   - Scanned with Burp Suite to identify SQL injection and XSS risks.

4. **Analysis & Reporting**
   - Captured traffic with Wireshark to confirm exploit traffic.
   - Documented findings and suggested mitigations.

## Sample Output
Example **Nmap Scan**:
